# TradeIN User Management System

## Overview

The TradeIN User Management System is a robust, secure, and comprehensive authentication and user profile management solution built with GraphQL, React, and modern web technologies.

## Authentication Flow

### 1. User Registration

#### Process
- Users provide detailed registration information:
  - Full Name
  - Email Address
  - Password
  - House Address
  - Contact Number

#### Validation Rules
- **Password Strength Requirements**:
  - Minimum length: 8 characters
  - Must contain:
    - Uppercase letters
    - Lowercase letters
    - Numbers
    - Special characters
  - Strength scoring mechanism

#### Registration Steps
1. Input validation on client-side
2. Send registration mutation to GraphQL backend
3. Backend creates user account
4. Generate email verification code
5. Redirect to email verification page

### 2. Email Verification

#### Process
- 6-digit verification code sent to user's email
- Code expires after 15 minutes
- Users can request a new code if expired

#### Verification Methods
- Enter code manually
- Automatic verification via email link

### 3. Login Process

#### Authentication Methods
- Email and password
- Optional: Social login (future enhancement)

#### Security Features
- JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication
- Token expiration and refresh mechanism
- Device and location tracking
- Brute-force protection

### 4. Profile Management

#### Editable Profile Information
- Name
- Email
- House Address
- Contact Number
- Profile Picture (future enhancement)

#### Security Controls
- Password change
- Two-factor authentication (future enhancement)
- Account deletion

## User Roles

### 1. Regular User
- Standard registration
- Limited platform access
- Can manage personal profile

### 2. Admin User
- Extended platform privileges
- Can manage system settings
- User management capabilities

## Authentication States

1. **Unauthenticated**
   - Can access public pages
   - Limited functionality

2. **Authenticated (Unverified)**
